- [Staquia 0.3.4](#V0.3.4) **Current**

## V0.3.4

- Naming `umd` to `staquia` removing special characters like `-` to be able to use the library with no need to use the global `this` as prefix.
- Fixing special imports to be able to import like `umd`, `esm` and `cjs`. Now any of the imports works with typescript.
- Mentionning in the readme the `guardex` dependency.
